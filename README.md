# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
This project is based on using Data Mining Techniques to predict the probability of a person having Heart Disease.

The prediction is done using Various Data Mining Tecniques such as:
1.) KNN Classification
2.) Logistic Regression Algorithm
3.) Decision Tree Algorithm
